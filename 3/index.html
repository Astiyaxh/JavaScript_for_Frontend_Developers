      <h2>by Astiyaxh</h2>
      
      <h3>Be Generous</h3>
      <p>
        "Success always calls for greater generosity--though most people, lost
        in the darkness of their own egos, treat it as an occasion for greater
        greed. Collecting boot [is] not an end itself, but only a means for
        building [an] empire. Riches would be of little use to us now--except as
        a means of winning new friends."
      </p>

      <h3>Be Self-Reliant</h3>
      <p>
        "Never be slow in replenishing your supplies. You'll always bee on
        better terms with your allies if you can secure your own
        provisions...Give them all they need and your troops will follow you to
        the end of the earth."
      </p>

      <h3>Be Brief</h3>
      <p>
        "Brevity is the soul of command. Too much talking suggests desperation
        on the part of the leader. Speak shortly, decisively and to the
        point--and couch your desires in such natural logic that no one can
        raise objections. Then move on."
